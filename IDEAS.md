## Labyrinth

* Type: Racing
* View: isometric
* Goals:
 - Follow a "light" threw a Racetrack labyrinth (e.g. Pacman) 
 - The Light makes random turns on each corner
 - Loose Health if you are too far away from light
* Comments:
 - Could be a multiuser game (on the same screen) 
 - the range where you wouldn't loose life could be large enough to drive on a parallal side road (allowing multiple "correct" tracks)
 - Camera should try to keep player and light in the same view
 - there could be health packs appearing (and weapons)
